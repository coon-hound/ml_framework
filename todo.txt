1. matrix multiplication equation si wrong. 
2. change the layers class to have the matrices of the correct size. 
      * we probably need to take into account the number of nodes int eh previous or next layer to determine the size of the weights          matrice

Matrix Dimesions:
    * activation matrix: 1 * (number of activation nodes)
    * weights matrix:    (number of activation nodes) * (number of nodes in the next layer)
    * bias matrix:       1 * (number of nodes in the next layer)
    * result matrix:     1 * (number of nodes in the next layer)
